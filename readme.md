The ON SPI Level Shifter is very similar to the ON Level Shifter at https://github.com/alexwhittemore/ON-Level-Shifter. It employs the ON Semi MC74VHC1GT126 to shift voltage levels from 2.5V or 3.3V on the low side to 3.3V or 5V on the high side. Wire the master to the master side, the slave to the slave side, and attach their respective power supplies. Either master or slave may be the high side.
